# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
A sorting algorithm visualizer implemented using html canvas and vanilla javascript

This repo implements numerous sorting algorithms including bubble sort, quick sort, merge sort, radix sort, and insertion sort. To start sorting, select the sorting algorithm from the dropdown and watch the sorting unfold. To choose a different algorithm, first press "reset", then choose the sorting algorithm you want. Press "reset" to reset the array into the original order. For an array of a given size, choose the size of the array using the number selector, then press "Random Array"; note that an array of 1 up to 500 is allowed. To shuffle the array, press "Shuffle".
